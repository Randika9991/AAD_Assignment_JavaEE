#  Java EE Project

This Java EE project exemplifies a sophisticated application structure, meticulously crafted to showcase a comprehensive division between its front-end and back-end components. Crafted with pedagogical intent, this project stands as an invaluable educational asset, offering a deep dive into the intricacies of Java EE development.

## Project Components

### Back-end

Fueling the Java EE Project with robust functionality, the backend architecture is meticulously crafted to operate seamlessly within the Apache Tomcat server environment. This foundational layer orchestrates intricate server-side operations, encompassing data processing, enforcing business logic, and facilitating seamless interactions with the underlying database.

Key Technologies:

- Java EE: Serving as the bedrock of the backend, Java EE empowers the project with a comprehensive suite of tools and frameworks tailored for enterprise-level development.
- Apache Tomcat: Serving as the hosting platform, Apache Tomcat provides a reliable and scalable environment for executing Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP), fundamental components of the Java EE ecosystem.

### Front-end


Front-end Development:
At the forefront of the Java EE Project lies the front-end development, orchestrating the delivery of a user-friendly interface and seamless interaction with underlying functionalities. Through adept utilization of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and AJAX, it breathes life into the project, rendering it dynamic and responsive.

Technologies Utilized:

- HTML: Serving as the foundational structure for presenting information, HTML lays the groundwork for the project's content organization and display.
- CSS: Elevating aesthetics and design, CSS adds style and visual appeal to the project's interface, enhancing the user experience.
- jQuery: Empowering interactivity and manipulation of HTML elements, jQuery facilitates dynamic client-side scripting, enriching the project's functionality.
- AJAX: Enabling asynchronous communication with the server, AJAX enhances responsiveness and user experience by fetching and updating data without page reloads.

## Project Structure

### Back-end

The back-end code is organized to follow best practices and maintainability. Important directories and files include:

- src/main/java: Directory containing Java classes.
- src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/: Configuration files for the JavaEE application.

### Front-end

The front-end code is organized in a structured manner, ensuring clarity and maintainability. Key directories and files include:

- index.html: The main entry point for the web application.
- contollers/: Directory for JavaScript files, including jQuery and AJAX functionality.
- assets/: Other resources used in the application, bootstrap, font-awesome and jquery
